## NOTE: This repo is being deprecated in favor of the more Go-like implementation, [slack-random-emoji-service](https://github.com/ciroque/slack-random-emoji-service).



A simple service that retrieves the emoji's defined in a Slack workspace and adds a slash command to get a random emoji and post it.
